Photosynthesis is the fundamental process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into chemical energy in the form of glucose (sugar), releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process takes place in specialized structures called chloroplasts within plant cells and is essential for life on Earth, providing the food and oxygen that sustain nearly all ecosystems.
