The star accounts for 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System, and most of the remaining mass is concentrated in eight planets whose orbits are practically circular and transit within a nearly flat disk called the ecliptic plane. The four closest, considerably smaller planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, also known as the terrestrial planets, are composed mainly of rock and metal. While the four most distant, called gas giants or "Jovian planets", more massive than the terrestrial ones, are composed of ice and gases. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are composed mainly of helium and hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, called ice giants, are composed mostly of frozen water, ammonia and methane.
