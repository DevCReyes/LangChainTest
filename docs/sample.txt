Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the transformation of energy, particularly the relationship between heat, work, and other forms of energy, at the macroscopic level. It is based on a set of four empirical laws that govern how energy and matter interact in physical systems, whether gases, solids, or liquids. Its applications are vast, ranging from engine design and electricity generation to cooking and the creation of new materials.
